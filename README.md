## Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is essential for financial institutions to protect their customers and prevent financial losses. This project uses machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data:
    ```python
    fraud = data[data['Class'] == 1]
    valid = data[data['Class'] == 0]
    outlierFraction = len(fraud) / float(len(valid))
    print(outlierFraction)
    print('Fraud Cases: {}'.format(len(fraud)))
    print('Valid Transactions: {}'.format(len(valid)))
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```python
    # Example code for training a machine learning model
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

    X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
    y = data['Class']

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
    ```

3. Evaluate the model:
    ```python
    # Example code for evaluating the model
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

    print('Confusion Matrix:')
    print(cm)
    print('Accuracy Score:', accuracy)
    ```

## Results
Include results of your model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any visualizations that help illustrate the effectiveness of the fraud detection model.
